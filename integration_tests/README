The purpose of these tests is to provide a basic framework for running Chef integration 
tests in local mode for systemd. These should not be run from the Chef server; they
should be executed from the client.

The script must be executed from this directory in your Chef repo directory.

This script takes a single argument:
	<test number>: this will run the test matching the given number.

Please run "chef-test-main.pl" without any arguments to view the help text and the
list of available tests.
